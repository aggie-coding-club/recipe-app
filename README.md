# recipe-app
Language: C++
IDE: Visualstudio / Xamarin

Main Idea:
The core idea of the project is an app that gives food recipes based on what food you already have.

Specifics:
App will have 3 main sections, “pantry”, shopping list and recipes.
•	Pantry section
o	Will allow user to input what they have
o	has ability to track stuff like expiration dates if entered
o	Recipes will be made from things in the pantry section
•	Shopping list
o	Basic shopping list, quantity and brand and whatnot 
o	Can easily check off objects of list to move to pantry section
•	Recipes
o	Searches recipes made with objects in pantry
o	Can add basic filters, like breakfast, lunch, dinner, cooking time, etc.
o	Could use google or other similar search engine to find recipes, rather than manually inputting all recipes
