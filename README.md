# recipe-app
Language: C++

IDE: Visualstudio / Xamarin

Meetings: Thursday at 4-5pm (Still in flux)

## Main Idea:
The core idea of the project is an app that gives food recipes based on what food you already have.

## Specifics:
App will have 3 main sections, “pantry”, shopping list and recipes.

#### Pantry section: 
- Will allow user to input what they have
- has ability to track stuff like expiration dates if entered
- Recipes will be made from things in the pantry section

#### Shopping list:
- Basic shopping list
- quantity and brand and whatnot
- Can easily check off objects of list to move to pantry section

#### Recipes:
- Searches recipes made with objects in pantry
- Can add basic filters, like breakfast, lunch, dinner, cooking time, etc. 
- Use search engine to find recipes, rather than manually inputting all recipes
